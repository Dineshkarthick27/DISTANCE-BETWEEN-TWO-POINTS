# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

### Step 2:
Mention the coordinates as given

### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula

### Step 4:
Assign the values of coordinates in the formula

### Step 5:
End the program
### Program:
```python

import math as np
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=np.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```


### OUTPUT:
